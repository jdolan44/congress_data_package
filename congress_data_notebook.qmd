how to lose points on project: - project is difficult to clone from github. make sure there's a list of packages needed.

-   check out geom_smooth.

```{r}
#| include: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12))
```


project notes:

- add writing for EDA.
- add better labels for each plot.

- do some comparisons with the party in power.
  - is pass percentage/bills sponsored affected by the party in power? check by congress, split by party.
  - maybe don't even need a plot, just show a table with the averages.
